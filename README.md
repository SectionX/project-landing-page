# project-landing-page
The Odin Project - Project: Landing Page

The main branch will be an exact replica of the original image without any customizations.
The finished product will be a template that anyone can use to personalize with a simple
script or by hand. As I'm not very familiar with JavaScript yet, any possible automations 
will be written in Python for the time being and it will create a static product by swapping
text. The final version of this website won't have any behavior unless a future TOP lesson
gives me a relevant assignment.

# Edit:

Instead of scripting, I decided to make it responsive and play around with media
queries. This website should respond up to 320px width. Let me know if you find any obvious
bug.

# tip of the day:

I assume that in one of the next lessons we will be introduced to browsersync or some other
way to automatically refresh index.html. One way to have this functionality without external
applications, is to use the following tag:

meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3"

Just don't forget to disable it for your final version.



# Update:

Finally finished. Perhaps playing around with media queries was a bit too much for now. I spent a lot of time making it responsive so I will probably take a break from
any other smart ideas like scripting a webpage maker. I'm quite proud of the result though.
Sure, media queries are a bit rushed and the dimensions aren't great but I don't think it's
too bad and it's my first time, even if I was familiar with the concept.

For anyone reading this, good luck in your next assignments.
