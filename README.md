The Odin Project - Project: Landing Page

The main branch will be an exact replica of the original image without any customizations.
The finished product will be a template that anyone can use to personalize with a simple
script or by hand. As I'm not very familiar with JavaScript yet, any possible automations 
will be written in Python for the time being and it will create a static product by swapping
text. The final version of this website won't have any behavior unless a future TOP lesson
give me a relevant assignment.
