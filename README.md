# project-landing-page
The Odin Project - Project: Landing Page

The main branch will be an exact replica of the original image without any customizations.
The finished product will be a template that anyone can use to personalize with a simple
script or by hand. As I'm not very familiar with JavaScript yet, any possible automations 
will be written in Python for the time being and it will create a static product by swapping
text. The final version of this website won't have any behavior unless a future TOP lesson
gives me a relevant assignment.

# tip of the day:

I assume that in one of the next lessons we will be introduced to browsersync or some other
way to automatically refresh index.html. One way to have this functionality without external
applications, is to use the following tag:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3">

Just don't forget to disable it for your final version.
